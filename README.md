# City Tours - WIP
â€‹City Tours is a planning/organization web app that allows users to search a locale for landmarks, restaurants, and other places of interest. A registered user can add their favorites to an itinerary and generate a travel route.

This project was created using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for the back end API and Vue.js for the front end as a Tech Elevator alumni project. It makes use of the Google Maps API for search functions and landmark data retrieval.
